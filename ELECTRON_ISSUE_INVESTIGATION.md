# Electron Module Loading Issue - Investigation Report

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Solution:** Installed Node.js v20 via nvm-windows and added environment variables:
- `C:\nvm4w`
- `C:\nvm4w\nodejs`

**See [SETUP_COMPLETE.md](SETUP_COMPLETE.md) for current setup and running instructions.**

---

## Problem Summary (RESOLVED)

The Electron application was failing to start with the error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'whenReady')
```

This issue affected **BOTH** the old code structure and the new reorganized structure, confirming it was a **system-level Electron runtime issue**, not a code organization problem.

## Root Cause (IDENTIFIED)

Node.js v22.20.0 was incompatible with Electron's process initialization. `process.type` was `undefined` when it should be `"browser"` for the main process. This caused `require('electron')` to return the path to electron.exe (a string) instead of the Electron API object, making all Electron APIs (`app`, `BrowserWindow`, etc.) undefined.

## Investigation Steps Performed

### 1. Tested Multiple Electron Versions
- Electron v27.3.11 - **Failed** (process.type: undefined)
- Electron v28.3.3 - **Failed** (process.type: undefined)
- Electron v38.3.0 (latest) - **Failed** (process.type: undefined)

### 2. Tested Both Code Structures
- Original flat structure (`main.js` in root) - **Failed**
- New organized structure (`src/main/index.js`) - **Failed**
- Even git-stashed original code - **Failed**

This confirms the issue is NOT related to the code reorganization.

### 3. Reinstallation Attempts
- Fresh npm install
- Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`)
- Deleted node_modules and package-lock.json
- Reinstalled from scratch multiple times

**Result:** Issue persists across all attempts.

## Technical Details

When Electron runs correctly:
- `process.type` should be `"browser"` in main process
- `process.type` should be `"renderer"` in renderer process
- `require('electron')` returns an object with APIs like `app`, `BrowserWindow`, etc.

What's happening instead:
- `process.type` is `undefined`
- `process.versions.electron` IS set correctly (e.g., "28.3.3", "38.3.0")
- `require('electron')` returns a string: the path to electron.exe
- This means Electron IS running, but not initializing its process environment properly

## Possible Causes

### 1. Node.js Version Incompatibility ⚠️
**System Node.js:** v22.20.0

Electron v28 bundles Node.js v18.18.2. There may be an incompatibility between the system Node.js v22 and how Electron initializes its environment.

### 2. Windows-Specific Issue
Running on Windows with Git Bash. Possible issues:
- Windows Defender or antivirus interference
- Path/environment variable conflicts
- Windows security features blocking Electron initialization

### 3. Corrupted Global npm/Node Configuration
- Global npm packages might be interfering
- npm config might have issues
- Node.js installation might be corrupted

### 4. System Security Software
- Antivirus blocking Electron's process initialization
- Windows Defender SmartScreen interfering
- Firewall rules affecting Electron

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Steps (Try in Order)

#### 1. Use a Node Version Manager (Recommended)
Install `nvm-windows` and use Node.js LTS v20:

```bash
# Install nvm-windows from: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
cd path/to/time-tracker-widget
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

#### 2. Check Antivirus/Windows Defender
- Temporarily disable Windows Defender/antivirus
- Try running the app
- If it works, add electron.exe to exclusions

#### 3. Run from Different Terminal
Try running from:
- Windows PowerShell (as Administrator)
- Windows Command Prompt (as Administrator)
- Not Git Bash

```cmd
cd d:\My_Projects_Repos\time-tracker-widget
node_modules\.bin\electron .
```

#### 4. Check for Global Package Conflicts
```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
# Look for any electron-related global packages and remove them
npm uninstall -g electron  # if present
```

#### 5. Reinstall Node.js
- Completely uninstall Node.js
- Download Node.js LTS v20 from nodejs.org
- Install fresh
- Reinstall project dependencies

#### 6. Try Portable Electron (Workaround)
Download a pre-built Electron binary and run directly:
```bash
# Download portable Electron v28 for Windows
# Extract and use electron.exe directly
```

### Long-Term Solution

Once you identify which step fixes the issue, document it for future reference. The most likely fix is switching to Node.js v20 LTS using nvm-windows.

## Project Status

### ✅ What Was Completed Successfully

1. **Project reorganization** - All files moved to proper directories
2. **Path updates** - All require() and file paths updated correctly
3. **Documentation** - PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md created
4. **Code structure** - Follows Electron best practices

The reorganized code IS correct and WILL work once the Electron environment issue is resolved.

### ⚠️ What Needs to Be Fixed

**System-level Electron initialization issue** - This is NOT a code problem.

## Verification Steps (After Fix)

Once Electron is working again, verify with:

```bash
# Test the reorganized structure
npm start

# Should see the app window open
# No errors in console
# process.type should be "browser"
```

## Files Modified During Investigation

- Removed debug console.log() statements from main files
- Removed test files (electron-test.js, test-package.json)
- All production code is clean and ready

##Contact/Support

If the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider:
1. Posting on Electron Discussions: https://github.com/electron/electron/discussions
2. Stack Overflow with tag `[electron]`
3. Include this error and investigation details

## Summary

**The project reorganization was successful.** The Electron runtime issue is unrelated to the code changes and affects even the original code. Follow the recommended solutions above to restore Electron functionality, then the reorganized structure will work perfectly.
