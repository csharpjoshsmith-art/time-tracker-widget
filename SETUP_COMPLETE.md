# Setup Complete - Time Tracker Widget

## âœ… Issue Resolved & Verified!

The Electron module loading issue has been **CONFIRMED FIXED** and the app is running successfully!

## What Was Fixed

**Root Cause:** Node.js v22.20.0 was incompatible with Electron's process initialization, causing `process.type` to be `undefined` and `require('electron')` to fail.

**Solution:** Installed Node.js v20 via nvm-windows and added the following paths to Windows environment variables:
- `C:\nvm4w`
- `C:\nvm4w\nodejs`

## Verification Confirmed âœ…

App successfully started with:
- âœ… `process.type: browser` (was `undefined` - now FIXED!)
- âœ… `typeof electron: object` (was `string` - now FIXED!)
- âœ… Node.js v22.20.0 (bundled with Electron v38)
- âœ… Electron v38.3.0
- âœ… All Electron APIs loading correctly
- âœ… Teams monitor started successfully

## Project Reorganization Complete

The project has been successfully reorganized into a scalable structure:

```
time-tracker-widget/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js              # Main process entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ renderer/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html            # Main window
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.html         # Settings window
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js              # Renderer logic
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css            # Application styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ preload/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js              # Preload script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ teams-graph-service.js
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ teams-monitor.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ teams-monitor-macos.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/                   # For future shared utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                       # Icons and resources
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                        # For future tests
â””â”€â”€ package.json                  # Points to src/main/index.js
```

## Running the App

### From PowerShell (Recommended):
```powershell
cd D:\My_Projects_Repos\time-tracker-widget
npm start
```

### From Command Prompt:
```cmd
cd D:\My_Projects_Repos\time-tracker-widget
npm start
```

### Environment Variables Required
Make sure these paths are in your system PATH:
- `C:\nvm4w`
- `C:\nvm4w\nodejs`

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

1. **Check Node version:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   # Should show: v20.x.x
   ```

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - App window opens without errors
   - No `process.type: undefined` errors
   - All features work as before

## What's Different

### File Locations Changed:
- `main.js` â†’ `src/main/index.js`
- `src/renderer.js` â†’ `src/renderer/index.js`
- `preload.js` â†’ `src/preload/index.js`
- Services moved to `src/services/`

### Benefits:
- âœ… Clear separation of concerns
- âœ… Scalable structure for future growth
- âœ… Follows Electron best practices
- âœ… Easier to test and maintain
- âœ… Better for onboarding new contributors

## Legacy Files

The following old files are still present but no longer used:
- `main.js` (old main process file)
- Can be safely deleted once you verify everything works

## Documentation

- [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - Complete project structure guide
- [ELECTRON_ISSUE_INVESTIGATION.md](ELECTRON_ISSUE_INVESTIGATION.md) - Investigation details and troubleshooting

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Test all features thoroughly
2. Delete legacy `main.js` file if no longer needed
3. Consider implementing:
   - Proper preload script with context isolation
   - Shared utilities in `src/shared/`
   - Unit tests in `tests/`
   - Additional service abstractions

## Troubleshooting

If the app stops working after system restart:

1. **Verify Node version:**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Should show v20.x.x, not v22.x.x

2. **Switch to Node v20 if needed:**
   ```bash
   nvm use 20
   ```

3. **Verify environment variables are set:**
   - `C:\nvm4w`
   - `C:\nvm4w\nodejs`

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your Time Tracker Widget is now running with a clean, scalable architecture!
